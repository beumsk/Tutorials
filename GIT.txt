GIT COMMANDS



Most important commands:

- git init // make directory become git project
- git status // get the status of git
- git clone https://github.com/8trust/godzilist.git // to clone 8trust github for example
OR git clone remote_location clone_name // clone the directory in a new one named

- git branch newbranch // create new branch called newbranch
- git checkout master (or any branchname) // move to that branch
- git add filename // add file to staging area
- git commit -m "message" // stores changes from staging area to repository with message

- git stash // keep modifications on stash to let you work on another branch without committing unfinished work
- git stash pop // to get your modifications stashed
- git stash apply // to keep modifications in stash

- git log // view historic of commits
- git merge branch_name // merge branch_name in actual branch
- git blame filename // list all modifications with modificators names

- git push origin your_branch_name // send commited to remote repository
- git pull origin your_branch_name // get latest updates from remote repository

/!\ It is crucial to keep sensible files (passwords, API, config, etc.) in a .gitignore file (should write paths to ignored files in .gitignore file)


Work with git lets you work on a project with multitude of people as long as you are methodical

Here is an exampe of the git-flow -> http://nurelm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/git-flow.png

Master branch handle the working code
Hotfix branch handle random bugs
Release branch handle last check before new release
Develop branch handle improvements to the code , including new features
Feature branches handle new features to be add to develop



-> create repository
-> create file
$ git init (make directory become git project)
$ git status (get status of git project)
$ git add filename (add file to staging area)
-> add some text
$ git diff filename (check differences) 
/!\ press 'q' to exit diff mode
$ git add filename (add changes to staging area)
$ git commit -m "message" (stores changes from staging area to repository with message)
$ git log (view historic of commits)

$ git show HEAD (show changes)
$ git checkout HEAD filename (restore to commit)
$ git reset HEAD filename (unstage a file from staging area)
$ git log (take the first seven characters of the commit version you want)
$ git reset 7777777 (the 7 characters to reset to that commit version)

$ git branch (know what branch you are on)
$ git branch new_branch (create new branch)
$ git checkout branch_name (switch to that branch)
$ git merge branch_name (update master branch with branch changes)
/!\ if both master and branch have changed 
-> conflict -> chose the version to keep
$ git branch -d branch_name (delete branch)

$ git clone remote_location clone_name (clone the directory in a new one named)
$ cd new_directory (to get there)
$ git remote -v (list remotes)
$ git fetch (fetch changes to remote)
$ git merge origin/master (update local master)
$ git push origin your_branch_name

1. $ git fetch
2. $ git merge origin/master
3. $ git branch new_branch
4. $ git checkout new_branch
5. -> work on project
6. $ git fetch
7. $ git merge origin/master
8. $ git push origin your_branch_name
